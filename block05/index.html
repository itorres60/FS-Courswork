            <p>
                Bears are very fuzzy.  They seem cuddly, but I probably won't try to snuggle a hungry momma bear trying to feed her babies any time soon.

            <p>
                Giraffes are very tall.  They seem playful, but I probably won't try to tickle a hungry momma giraffe trying to feed her babies any time soon.

            <p>
                Lions are very majestic.  They seem competative, but I probably won't be challenging a hungry momma lion to game of tag a any time soon.

            <p>
                Monkeys are very fast.  They seem friendly, but I probably won't try to debate a hungry momma monkey trying to feed her babies any time soon.

            <p>
                Aligators are very serious.  They do not seem to like company, so I probably won't by trying to hang out with a hungry momma aligator trying to feed her babies any time soon.
